# ChemLab1
Please change naming of each lab jsp to labX_Y.jsp where X is the section (0 for chem1 
and 1 for chem2) and Y is the number of the lab. This is mostly to test commit, etc.
# update
Changed to 0, and 1 (rather than 1 and 2) makes a bit more sense, i've made all the 
changes to file names rather than changing code.
